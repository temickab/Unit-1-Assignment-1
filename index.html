        <!--Temicka Brown - 1/8/2019 - index.html
    This organization is about giving Elderly and Disabled adults and children
    better access to certified service animals. It's a program I have always wanted
    to actually do but I think it's a good way to start.-->

        <h2>Purpose of Love2Love</h2>
        <p>Basically my organization is about a program that will 
        help elderly people and disabled children pick the right service dogs.
            I want them to have better access to service animals and discounted 
            veterinarian care for their service animals.</p>
